## Usage

### Create a project

```terminal
npx hoppen
```

### Start an existing project

from the root of your project, run:

```terminal
npx hoppen start [project-name]
```

## Why Hoppen?

Codepen is great for prototyping, but iterating on a project with AI is a pain.

Hoppen allows you to iterate on a project while benefiting from the power of your favorite IDE and AI tools.

Export your project to CodePen whenever you want.

That's useful for educational purposes, for example to show a project at different stages of development. That's an handy way to version your project.

## Features

- Scaffold a project with your favorite libraries and frameworks (GSAP, THREE.js, r3f, shaders, Lenis)
- One-click export to CodePen
- Hot module replacement (HMR)

### Internal files

Hoppen creates a internal folder `@@internal` that contains the CodePen Prefill helper, the reset.css file, and scripts for HMR when shaders are enabled.

### Requirements

- Node.js 18+
